# Evan Meagher's Emacs configuration

Not intended as a starter kit, but hopefully documented enough to be helpful. Patches or advice appreciated.

Influenced by (and in a few cases copied from) [al3x](https://github.com/al3x/emacs), [stevej](https://github.com/stevej/emacs), and [mitchellh](https://github.com/mitchellh/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs.d).

## Installation
    git clone --recursive git://github.com/evnm/emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
